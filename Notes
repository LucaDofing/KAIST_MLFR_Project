Why GNN: robotic systems are graphs (joints = nodes, links = edges), requiring variable-size input handling.
Why GCN: simple, efficient, good for static graphs where local physical influences dominate.


Upgrades to consider
- GAT (Graph Attention Network) --> Learn which joints matter more dynamically
- MPNN (Message Passing Neural Networks) --> Model richer interactions between joints
- Temporal GNNs --> Capture motion over time, not just one snapshot
